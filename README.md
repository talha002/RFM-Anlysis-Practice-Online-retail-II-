# RFM Anlysis Practice

## Hello Everyone,

I have open this respository to share RFM analysis practice. I have used a dataset which includes anonymous custormers data. I have upload the dataset which named as "online_retail_II.csv" to repo as well. You can find the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci). Dataset includes all the transactions from non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. We will look at the transactions from 2010.

The dataset has 8 columns:
1. InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal. A 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with the letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.
2. StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal. A 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
3. Description: Product (item) name. Nominal.
4. Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.
5. InvoiceDate: Invice date and time. Numeric. The day and time when a transaction was generated.
6. UnitPrice: Unit price. Numeric. Product price per unit in sterling (Â£).
7. CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal. A 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
8. Country: Country name. Nominal. The name of the country where a customer resides.
